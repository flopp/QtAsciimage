# QtAsciimage
QtAsciimage - Asciimage for Qt Applications

This is a C++/Qt version of [Charles Parnot](https://twitter.com/cparnot)'s [ASCIImage](http://asciimage.org/) format. ASCIImage let's you specify simple images directly in your source code using 'ASCII art'.

## Format Extension
QtAsciimage uses an extended format allowing for a direct styling of the individual ASCIImage shapes. The styling rules are appended to the ASCIImage, separated by a line containing three dashes `---` only:

    . . . . 5 . . . .
    . . . . # . . . .
    . . . . # . . . .
    . . . . # . . . .
    . . 1 . # . 3 . .
    . . . # 5 # . . .
    6 . . . 2 . . . 9
    # . . . . . . . #
    7 # # # # # # # 8
    ---
    1 open color=#FF0000
    5 color=#FF0000
    6 open 

A styling rule contains of a shape identifier (the character that is used in the ASCIImage to start the corresponding shape) and a set of styling options:
    
    ID [color=#RRGGBB] [open] [empty] [cutting]

*   `ID`
Shape identifier. The character that is used to start the curresponding shape. E.g. in the above example the polyline made from the consecutive characters `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` is identified by the shaped first character `6`. 

*   `color=#RRGGBB`
Applicable to all shape types.
The shape is drawn in the given hex-color instead of the default color (black).

*   `open`
Applicable to polygons.
The shape is not automatically closed, and thus drawn as a polyline instead of a polygon. 

*   `empty`
Applicable to ellipses and polygons.
The shape is not filled; only the edge is drawn.

*   `cutting`
Applicable to all shape types.
Instead of drawing the shape, it is cut out of the previsously drawn shapes, leaving a 'hole'.

Styling rules and the styling rules section are completely optional; if there is no styling rule for a shape, it is drawn in the default style (black color, closed, and filled).

## Usage 
To include QtAsciimage into your QMake-based project, copy the QtAsciimage directory to your project tree and `include()` QtAsciimage's `pri`-file in you main QMake-file:

    include(QtAsciimage/QtAsciimage.pri)

Of course you need to `include()` QtAsciimage's header files (`QtAsciimage/image.h` should normally suffice; you also need `QtAsciimage/iconengine.h` if you want to use the QIconEngine) into your C++ sources. 

### Rendering to QImage

```C++
#include <QtAsciimage/image.h>
// ...

asciimage::Image asciiSun({
  ". . . . 8 . . . .",
  ". 7 . . 8 . . 9 .",
  ". . 7 . . . 9 . .",
  ". . . . 1 . . . .",
  "6 6 . 1 # 1 . 2 2",
  ". . . . 1 . . . .",
  ". . 5 . . . 3 . .",
  ". 5 . . 4 . . 3 .",
  ". . . . 4 . . . ."
});

int scale = 4;
QImage result = asciiSun.render(scale);
```

### Rendering via QIconEngine

```C++
#include <QtAsciimage/image.h>
#include <QtAsciimage/iconengine.h>
// ...

asciimage::Image asciiSaveIcon({
  ". . . . 5 . . . .",
  ". . . . # . . . .",
  ". . . . # . . . .",
  ". . . . # . . . .",
  ". . 1 . # . 3 . .",
  ". . . # 5 # . . .",
  "6 . . . 2 . . . 9",
  "# . . . . . . . #",
  "7 # # # # # # # 8",
  "---",
  "1 open",
  "6 open"
});
QIconEngine* iconEngine = new asciimage::IconEngine(asciiSaveIcon);
QAction* saveAction = new QAction("Save", this);
saveAction->setIcon(QIcon(iconEngine));
// add saveAction to a toolbar/menu to display the icon
```

## Demo Program / QtAsciimageEditor

QtAsciimageEditor let's you edit Asciimages visually and, furthermore, demos how to use the QtAsciimage library.
